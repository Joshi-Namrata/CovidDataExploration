# Covid Data Exploration & Analysis

This project is about data exploration and analysis of Covid dataset using SQL queries in `BigQuery` and creating visualizations of the analyzed data in `Tableau`.

## Skills
* SQL 
    * `Joins`, 
    * `Agrregate functions` 
    * `GROUP BY` 
    * `PARTITION BY` 
    * `Temp tables`
* Creating visualization dashboard in `Tableau`.

## Lessons Learned
* Understanding the data and it's components first is helpful before starting to clean and analyze it.
* Exploring the large dataset with sorting and using different filters in SQL narrows the search and gets to the required information easily.
* Understanding the question I am trying to answer first helps me save time to write appropriate queries. 
* Selecting appropriate visualizations for different types of data makes it easier to convey the information.
* Last but not the least, it's crutial to save work periodically after finishing it to avoid losing work and having to redo it. 

## Challenges faced
* It took me some time to figure out that query results can be saved in new tables in the dataset which I can use them later for future queries and creating visualizations.
* I was unable to save the complete query results of some of my queries in spreadsheets which I wanted to use them for visualizations in tableau later. Hence, I decided to filter my query results and focus on visualizations for covid data for a specific continent.
